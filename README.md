## Description
This modification only works on forums with multiple interface lOCATION. Adds a fake custom field for selecting the lOCATION when the new user is registering - it displayed both during manual registration through the admin, and during self-registration of users. After registering, the user will immediately get a forum with the interface location he choose.
